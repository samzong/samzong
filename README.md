# Hi, I'm Samzong(船长) 👋

> **I build large-scale AI inference and scheduling systems.**
>
> My work focuses on making **LLMs routable, schedulable, and operable** at cluster scale. I help shape production-grade infrastructure that powers the AI era.

(AI Infra & Cloud Native TPM at **[@DaoCloud](https://github.com/DaoCloud)**)

## What I build?

* **Large-scale Inference Scheduling**: Optimizing GPU utilization across clusters.
* **Multi-model Routing**: Intelligent traffic governance for heterogeneous models.
* **Production LLMOps**: Moving from "demo" to "day-2" operations.
* **Cloud-Native Abstractions**: Defining standard APIs for AI workloads.

## Contributions

* **[semantic-router](https://github.com/vllm-project/semantic-router)** **(Committer, Current Focus)**: Defining the decision-making layer for multi-model LLM serving.
* **[llm-d](https://github.com/llm-d)**: Building the cloud-native infrastructure for disaggregated LLM inference.
* **[HAMi](https://github.com/Project-HAMi/HAMi)** & **[Kueue](https://kueue.sigs.k8s.io/)**: Used in Kubernetes-native batch scheduling & GPU virtualization.
* **[Istio](https://istio.io/)**: Standardizing traffic governance for service mesh.
* **[Karmada](https://github.com/karmada-io/karmada)** & **[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/)**: Essential for multi-cluster orchestration at scale.

## Side Tools

I build tools to fix my own problems.

* **[Chrome TabBoost](https://github.com/samzong/chrome-tabboost)**: Browser tab overload is a bug. I patched it with an extension.
* **[MacMusicPlayer](https://github.com/samzong/MacMusicPlayer)**: A minimalist, clean music player for macOS.
* **[ConfigForge](https://github.com/samzong/ConfigForge)**: Manage `~/.ssh/config` and `kubeconfig` without the headache.
* **[gmc](https://github.com/samzong/gmc)**: AI-powered Git commit messages.
* **[mdctl](https://github.com/samzong/mdctl)**: AI-powered Markdown workflow automation.
* **[hf-model-downloader](https://github.com/samzong/hf-model-downloader)**: Painless Hugging Face model downloads.
* **[LogoWallpaper](https://github.com/samzong/LogoWallpaper)**: Generating brand assets shouldn't take 30 minutes.
* **[SaveEye](https://github.com/samzong/SaveEye)**: A minimalist eye care reminder that doesn't annoy you.
* **[homebrew-tap](https://github.com/samzong/homebrew-tap)**: I deliver binaries. I don't just dump code. (`brew tap samzong/homebrew-tap`)
* **[mirrormate](https://github.com/samzong/mirrormate)**: Docker pulls failing? I fixed it with magic.
* **[swagger-online](https://github.com/samzong/swagger-online)**: Unified Swagger UI. No more tab chaos.
* **[ai-icon-generator](https://github.com/samzong/ai-icon-generator)**: I needed icons, so I built a generator.
