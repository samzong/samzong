# My-LLM-tool

This repo lists the large language model (LLM) tools I use, including details about usage duration,
payment status, and specific applications for each tool.

It's a personal record to track my engagement with various AI models and tools.

## Current Status

- 20$/Month Winner: `ChatGPT Plus`
- 200$/Year Winner: **Don't buy an annual subscription**

## Description

I have a budget of $20/Month for purchasing AI models.In addition, 
I have added a dynamic budget of $20-$40 per month to try new products or features.
AI evolves rapidly, and I must allocate additional funds to keep up.
I do not recommend purchasing annual subscriptions.
